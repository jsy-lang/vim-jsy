# vim-jsy

JSY JavaScript dialect syntax bundle for vim.

JSY is **an indented (offside) JavaScript dialect**. We believe indentation is
better at describing code blocks instead of painstakingly matching open/close
sections `{ } () []`.

Think modern JavaScript — ES6, ES2018 — indented similar to [Python][] or [CoffeeScript][].

Please see [JSY language docs](https://github.com/jsy-lang/jsy-lang-docs) for details on the JSY dialect.
